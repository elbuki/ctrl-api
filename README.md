# ctrl API

This is the gRPC API that is responsible of handling the actions coming from the client by ensuring secure communication.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running in your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

TBD

#### macOS support

There's a setting that is specific of macOS that needs to be activated depending on the application that you're going to use to run the compiled binary. In the following screenshot I'm using the native macOS terminal to run the compiled binary and in order to see it working we need to check the Terminal app within the Accessibility settings. [See more](https://github.com/micmonay/keybd_event/issues/20#issuecomment-618265093).
